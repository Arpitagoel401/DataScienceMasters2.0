    "Bagging reduces overfitting in decision trees by creating multiple subsets of the training data through random sampling with replacement. Each subset is used to train a different decision tree. Since each tree is trained on a different subset, they capture different aspects of the data. When making predictions, the final result is typically averaged across all trees (for regression) or determined by a majority vote (for classification), which helps to reduce the variance and thus overfitting.\n",

Conversely, using simple base learners with high bias and low variance (e.g., shallow decision trees) may increase bias in the ensemble but reduce variance. \n",
