Each coefficient represents the change in the target variable for a one-unit change in the corresponding feature, holding other features constant. However, due to the combination of L1 and L2 regularization, the interpretation is not as straightforward as in traditional linear regression. Non-zero coefficients indicate the importance of the corresponding features, while zero coefficients suggest that the associated features have been effectively excluded from the model."
