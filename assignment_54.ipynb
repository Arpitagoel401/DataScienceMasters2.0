    "Decision tree classifier is a popular supervised learning algorithm used for both classification and regression tasks. The algorithm works by recursively partitioning the input space into regions that are homogeneous with respect to the target variable. It builds a tree-like structure where each internal node represents a feature, each branch represents a decision based on that feature, and each leaf node represents a class label or a regression value.\n",
    "\n",
    "To make predictions, the algorithm traverses the decision tree from the root node to a leaf node, following the decision rules at each internal node based on the feature values of the input instance. At the leaf node, the predicted class label is determined. The decision rules are learned during the training phase, where the algorithm selects the feature that best splits the data into pure or homogeneous subsets at each node based on certain criteria, such as Gini impurity or information gain."

    "Decision tree classification relies on splitting the feature space based on the values of features. This is often done by selecting thresholds for each feature and determining which threshold provides the best separation between classes. The mathematical intuition behind this lies in metrics like Gini impurity or information gain, which quantify the homogeneity of the data at a particular node.\n",

    "Gini impurity measures the probability of misclassifying an instance if it were randomly labeled according to the class distribution in the dataset. Information gain, on the other hand, measures the reduction in entropy or disorder in the dataset after a split based on a particular feature. Both metrics aim to find the feature and threshold that maximizes the purity of the resulting subsets."
