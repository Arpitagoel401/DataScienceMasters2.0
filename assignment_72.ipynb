    "A projection is the transformation of data points from a higher-dimensional space to a lower-dimensional subspace. In PCA (Principal Component Analysis), projections are used to project high-dimensional data onto a lower-dimensional subspace defined by the principal components. These projections capture the maximum variance in the data while minimizing information loss."

Selecting fewer principal components results in greater dimensionality reduction but may lead to loss of information.

Therefore, the optimal number of principal components depends on the specific application and the trade-off between dimensionality reduction and information preservation."
