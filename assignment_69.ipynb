    "The main difference between Euclidean and Manhattan distance metrics lies in how they measure distance between two points in a multidimensional space.\n",
    "Euclidean distance measures the straight-line distance between two points, while Manhattan distance measures the distance between two points by summing the absolute differences of their coordinates along each dimension.\n",
    "The choice of distance metric can affect the performance of a KNN classifier or regressor depending on the dataset and the underlying data distribution.\n",
    "Euclidean distance is more sensitive to variations in magnitude along different dimensions, making it suitable for datasets where all features contribute equally to the distance calculation.\n",
    "Manhattan distance, on the other hand, is less sensitive to outliers and variations in magnitude, making it suitable for datasets with non-uniform feature scales or categorical variables."
